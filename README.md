# Sentiment Analysis

A small project where I perform sentiment analysis on some tweets.

I'm using the [SemEval-2013](https://aclanthology.org/S13-2052/) dataset for this project.

## Dependencies

Make sure that you have python **>= 3.10** installed.

To install the modules used run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

After that the notebook can be run.
It will install any missing nltk dependencies.
